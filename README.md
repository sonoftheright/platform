This is a simple platform layer that provides simple inputs and an OpenGL rendering capabilities for either MacOS or Windows.

In order to compile the example program, you should just run `./compile_and_run.sh` in either your Mac console or `./compile_and_run.bat` in Windows.

Requires clang to be installed, as well as the standard OS development packages.

All that is expected of the example program right now is:
- a simple FPS counter rendered in the window (in the upper left)
- a 'toggle mouselock' instruction text
- a vertex-colored cube at the origin
- a "Quit" button rendered in the upper right.
